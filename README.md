## üìÅ Dataset

- The dataset used for this assignment is available at <a href="https://incubytein-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/akash_incubyte_co/EWbzbiLBCxNHogEQHUF0i7MBkK-86jKetzVDT4t0d-wZog?rtime=uhJY6RlI3Ug">`[assessment_dataset.csv]`</a>.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Analysis Steps

1. **Data Cleaning:** Performed basic data validation and cleaning to handle missing or incorrect entries.
2. **Aggregate Analysis:** Computed total sales, average sales, and growth rates.
3. **Drill-Down Analysis:** Generated detailed insights based on product, region, and customer segments.

## üíæ SQL Scripts

The SQL scripts used for data analysis are located in the `sql-scripts` folder. Below are some key queries:

- **Total Sales Calculation:** 
  ```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(TransactionAmount) AS Total_Sale
FROM
    assessment_dataset;
    ```

- **Average Transaction Amount:** 
  ```sql
SELECT 
    AVG(TransactionAmount) AS Avg_Transaction_Amount
FROM
    assessment_dataset;```

- **City-Wise Online vs In-Store Sale:** 
  ```sql
SELECT 
    City,
    StoreType,
    SUM(Quantity) AS Quantity,
    SUM(TransactionAmount) AS Transaction_Amount
FROM
    assessment_dataset
GROUP BY City , StoreType
ORDER BY City , Transaction_Amount DESC;```

- **City-Wise Return:** 
  ```sql
SELECT 
    City,
    SUM(Quantity) AS Quantity,
    SUM(TransactionAmount) AS Transaction_Amount
FROM
    assessment_dataset
WHERE
    Returned = 'Yes'
GROUP BY City
ORDER BY Transaction_Amount DESC;```

- **Discount Impact on Sale:** 
  ```sql
SELECT 
    CASE
        WHEN DiscountPercent BETWEEN 0 AND 10 THEN '0-10%'
        WHEN DiscountPercent BETWEEN 11 AND 20 THEN '11-20%'
        WHEN DiscountPercent BETWEEN 21 AND 30 THEN '21-30%'
        WHEN DiscountPercent BETWEEN 31 AND 40 THEN '31-40%'
        WHEN DiscountPercent BETWEEN 41 AND 50 THEN '41-50%'
        WHEN DiscountPercent BETWEEN 51 AND 60 THEN '51-60%'
        WHEN DiscountPercent BETWEEN 61 AND 70 THEN '61-70%'
        WHEN DiscountPercent BETWEEN 71 AND 80 THEN '71-80%'
        WHEN DiscountPercent BETWEEN 81 AND 90 THEN '81-90%'
        WHEN DiscountPercent BETWEEN 91 AND 100 THEN '91-100%'
        ELSE '0-10%'
    END AS Discount,
    SUM(TransactionAmount) AS TotalSales
FROM
    assessment_dataset
GROUP BY Discount
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;```

- **Monthly Sales Performance:** 
  ```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(STR_TO_DATE(TransactionDate, '%d/%m/%Y %H:%i'),
            '%M') AS Months,
    SUM(TransactionAmount) AS TotalSales,
    COUNT(TransactionID) AS TotalTransactions
FROM
    assessment_dataset
WHERE
    TransactionDate IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY Months
ORDER BY TotalSales;```

## üìö Instructions

- Copy and execute these queries in your SQL environment for data analysis.
- Replace `assessment_dataset` with your specific dataset name if necessary.
